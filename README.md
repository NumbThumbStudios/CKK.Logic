# (CKK) Corey's Knick Knacks

**CKK** (Corey's Knick Knacks) represents a school project for **Ogden-Weber Technical College**. 
I employed **WPF** for the Inventory Management System, harnessed the power of **Blazor** and **Razor Pages** for the web interface, 
and leveraged **Dapper** for efficient database management. All these components were meticulously crafted within the **Visual Studio environment**, 
using the **C#** programming language.


**Inventory Management System:** Crafted with WPF and C#
